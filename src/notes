Collections framework
Iterable is parent of
collection is parent of
SET, LIST and Queue

SET - no duplicates, unordered
LISTS - duplicates, order is significant. Removing lots of elevements
in the middle of a list would be faster then in an array but takes up more memory since it
holds a reference to the memory, next and previous linked list.
QUEUE - first in first out operations
MAP - key-value pairs

linked hashmap - secures that the order of the hashmap remains
Streams use internal iteration instead of external iteration. it's more efficient
 and seperates loops and abstracts.

Streams, a stream can only flow in or out.
InputStreams, abstract
OutputStreams, abstract
